    Semantically mark up an essay on Carl Dair’s Seven Principles of Typographic Contrast. To begin, open up the HTML template document in your text editor, and copy and paste the content from the essay into the template at the appropriate location. Mark-up the document by keeping in mind which HTML tags are appropriate for which segments of content. Test your results by opening the html file in Chrome. Upload your html file to your Github repository, and post the link in Slack. </p>

   You will select a transcript from an interview from an online source. Using your selected text, republish the interview onto a single webpage such that it targets a different audience than the original interview. Establish distinct typographic styling for each alternating voice — consider font, size, color and scale. Integrate at least 4 images into the body of the interview that are relevant to the content discussed in the interview.</p>

   Choose a letter from the alphabet (except I, L, and T), and create more than 5 different shapes of the letter using only HTML and CSS. Based on what we covered in the lecture, how would you create complex shapes using only CSS? Think about how geometric shapes and its variations can be applied to the letterform. Consider using color, shadow, and transparency, explore the positive and negative space of the letterform.</p>

  A visual catalog of all the top female protagonists in classic films ranging from the decades 80s, 90s, and 2000’s. I want this catalog to serve as a resource for other women to discover new films, but what I am most interested in is seeing just how many of these women are white. While this can serve as an aid and a platform for an already misrepresented group (women), I am most interested in seeing the bigger picture once all the images are placed together. </p>

  This is a ficticious site for a Wiener Festival in Los Angeles, inspired by many current festivals, I wanted to make a brand identity inspired project while still working with the theme of change. I incorporated change by creating a hot dog countdown to the event with various animations to illustrate the growing excitement for the event.  </p>
