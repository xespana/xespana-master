    <p>Semantically mark up an essay on Carl Dairâ€™s Seven Principles of Typographic Contrast. To begin, open up the HTML template document in your text editor, and copy and paste the content from the essay into the template at the appropriate location. Mark-up the document by keeping in mind which HTML tags are appropriate for which segments of content. Test your results by opening the html file in Chrome. Upload your html file to your Github repository, and post the link in Slack with the channel #projects-exercise.</p>
