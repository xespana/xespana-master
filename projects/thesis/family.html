  <p> This is a series of 15 Spanish Flash Cards of palabras and phrases you should know. The most challenging part of designing these cards is that most of them do ot have a simple graphic visual or it is not easily translatable to a non-Spanish speaker. Hopefully these cards will not only teach you but share some words you may have never seen in a Spanish high school textbook.
    <br> </br>
This deck will teach you cool slang, funny insults, and some random words you can use to communicate with native speakers in casual settings. Just like you learned your native tongue, native Spanish speakers learned formal vocabulary in school and more conversational aspects of language outside of the classroom. This deck is a series of words I came to know from overhearing my family members use them or from watching telenovelas.
